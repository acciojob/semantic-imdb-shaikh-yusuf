			Indian actor, film producer, and television personality who works in Hindi films. Referred to in the media

			Khan began his career with appearances in several television series in the late 1980s. He made his Bollywood
			debut in 1992 with Deewana. Early in his career, Khan was recognised for portraying villainous roles in the
			films Baazigar (1993), Darr (1993), and Anjaam (1994). He then rose to prominence starring in a series of

			Ansar is an Arabic term that means helpers or supporters. They were the citizens of Medina who helped
			Prophet Mohammed upon His arrival to the Holy city. While 'Hussain' is a derivation of 'Hassan' that means
			'GOOD' (I also owe this one to Khaled Hosseini).
			That's how my favorite character in my debut novel 'When Strangers meet..' gets his name... HUSSAIN ANSARI,
			because he is the one who helps Jai realize the truth in the story and inspires his son, Arshad, to have
			FAITH in Allah.
